TRAINING PERFORMANCE TRACKER 
----------------------------
  The lack of centralized and standardized systems for monitoring and evaluating student 
progress presents several challenges which includes Limited Visibility into Student Achievements, Ineffective Matching for Placement Opportunities and Bounded Effectiveness.

SOLUTION :
--------
  To overcome these challenges and enable students to demonstrate their capabilities 
effectively, it's essential to develop a robust Student Training Performance Tracker. This 
platform involves collaborative efforts between students and faculty to create a comprehensive 
dashboard encompassing all relevant information, thereby fostering optimal matching for 
placement opportunities. By facilitating thorough skill documentation, streamlining evaluation 
processes, and providing targeted placement matching, this system aims to enhance students' 
career preparedness and elevate their likelihood of achieving successful placement outcomes
